# EECS-1022-Term-Project
make a new project call it whatever you want then copy paste each screens code onto it.
so for example create a bew java class and name it UserGenerated then copy the xml part and the java part and do that for every screen.
//Password screen does not have a search bar yet but the app will still work without it ill try and add it later
